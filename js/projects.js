      "In this project, I have used the popular Javascript library React to create a client for a school database REST API (that I created in a previous project). This project allows users to view a list of all of the courses held in the API, and view all of the details for each course. Users may also register an account, or sign in with an existing account, to create, update and delete existing courses. I have also implemented a number of validation methods to ensure that users cannot update or delete projects that do not belong to them.",

      "Many immensely popular sites, such as IMDB, Facebook & Twitter, provide data that can be displayed on external websites via the use of APIs. This project makes use of a public API to display 9 randomly selected users on to a webpage. The program allows you to search through the selected profiles, and launch a modal view of each user, by clicking directly on itâ€™s thumbnail. This modal window provides far more detail on the selected user. From the modal window, the user can either close the window, or scroll backwards/forwards through the results.",
