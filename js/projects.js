      "Grand Technical required a lightning-fast, mobile-first responsive website to showcase it's main services to a range of clients across the capital. I built this site from the ground up to be as visually appealing as possible. To ensure the site was loading as fast as possible, I used webp formats for all images, svg sprites, and minified the CSS and JS files. The site has since seen a huge increase in enquiries, sales and search engine rankings, mostly due to a greatly enhanced user experience!",

      "In this project, I have used the popular Javascript library React to create a client for a school database REST API (that I created in a previous project). This project allows users to view a list of all of the courses held in the API, and view all of the details for each course. Users may also register an account, or sign in with an existing account, to create, update and delete existing courses. I have also implemented a number of validation methods to ensure that users cannot update or delete projects that do not belong to them.",

The site is optimised to provide a top-end user experience across mobile, tablet and desktop platforms. As well as displaying traffic informaton via charts, the app also displays widgets that showcase alerts, the latest user registrations, and comments in a forum. Lastly, the app makes use of localstorage to store the user's preferences for their next visit. ",

      "Many immensely popular sites, such as IMDB, Facebook & Twitter, provide data that can be displayed on external websites via the use of APIs. This project makes use of a public API to display 9 randomly selected users on to a webpage. The program allows you to search through the selected profiles, and launch a modal view of each user, by clicking directly on itâ€™s thumbnail. This modal window provides far more detail on the selected user. From the modal window, the user can either close the window, or scroll backwards/forwards through the results.",
